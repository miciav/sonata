"""Core workflow primitives: tasks, resources, selection, and compiled results.

This package is the stable surface for building and running a workflow: the
`Task` hierarchy and its `Steps` composite, the `Resource` lifecycle pairing,
`Workflow` itself, and the immutable compiled/result types the runner returns.
Everything here is re-exported for import from `sonata_engine.core`; the
sibling modules are implementation detail behind that list.
