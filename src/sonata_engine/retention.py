"""Releasing what a kept run left behind, from a later process.

`keep` holds resources past the end of a run so the next one need not rebuild
them. Whoever asked for that eventually has to give them back, and by then the
`_RunState` that held their acquired values is gone. The journal's retention
records are what survives, so releasing from a later process means reading them
rather than re-running the workflow that created them.

Deliberately not fingerprint-checked. Resume refuses a journal whose workflow
shape changed, because reusing evidence across a different topology is unsound.
Releasing is the opposite: a VM left running does not care that the DAG moved on,
and refusing to release it is how it stays up.
